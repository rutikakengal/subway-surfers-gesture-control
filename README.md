# subway-surfers-gesture-control
A fun twist on the classic Subway Surfers, this project replaces keyboard controls with hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe. Players can jump, slide, and move left or right in real time with simple hand gestures, creating a touchless and immersive gaming experience.
